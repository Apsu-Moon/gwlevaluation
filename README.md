# gwlevaluation

GWLEvaluation is a Python package designed to evaluate machine learning models for groundwater level prediction. It includes tools to automatically identify critical points, calculate custom metrics like peak bias and timing score, making it ideal for assessing models where accurate timing of peaks and jumps is critical.

## Features
- Identify critical points in time series data, including peaks and jumps, rising points during hydrological events
- Calculate custom metrics for model evaluation, such as:
  - Peak bias
  - Timing score
- Flexible and easy-to-use functions for evaluating machine learning models.
